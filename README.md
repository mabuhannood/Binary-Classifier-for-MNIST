# Ex-4: Binary Classifier for MNIST

## Overview
In this exercise, you will implement a binary classifier to classify a single number from the MNIST dataset. You will be required to complete the functions provided in the Python files.

## Objectives
1. Define dense models with single and hidden layers.
2. Train a model to classify a single digit from the MNIST dataset.
3. Evaluate the performance of the trained model.

## The Assignment
You are required to complete the following functions in 'layered_model.py'. Your completed functions should pass the tests provided.
1. `define_dense_model_single_layer`: Define a dense model with a single layer.
2. `define_dense_model_with_hidden_layer`: Define a dense model with a hidden layer.
3. `fit_mnist_model_single_digit`: Train the model for a single digit classification.
4. `evaluate_mnist_model_single_digit`: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
